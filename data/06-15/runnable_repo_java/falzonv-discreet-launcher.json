If users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If users provide you with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, each user has given you permission to do so.\n[Build Project/build]   | \n[Build Project/build]   | 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the Preview, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of Google or any third party.\n[Build Project/build]   | \n[Build Project/build]   | 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.\n[Build Project/build]   | \n[Build Project/build]   | 4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.\n[Build Project/build]   | \n[Build Project/build]   | 4.7 The Preview is in development, and your testing and feedback are an important part of the development process. By using the Preview, you acknowledge that implementation of some features are still under development and that you should not rely on the Preview having the full functionality of a stable release. You agree not to publicly distribute or ship any application using this Preview as this Preview will no longer be supported after the official Android SDK is released.\n[Build Project/build]   | \n[Build Project/build]   | 5.

The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the above courts.\n[Build Project/build]   | \n[Build Project/build]   | 10.2 Remedies. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, as well as any disclosure, commercialization, or public use of the Evaluation Materials, would cause irreparable injury to MIPS, and therefore Recipient agrees to consent to, and hereby consents to, the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of an actual or threatened breach.\n[Build Project/build]   | \n[Build Project/build]   | 10.3 Assignment. Recipient may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license granted or any of Recipient\u2019s rights, obligations, or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, by way of merger (regardless of whether Recipient is the surviving entity) or acquisition, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without MIPS\u2019 express prior written consent, shall be ineffective, null and void. MIPS may freely assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.\n[Build Project/build]   | \n[Build Project/build]   | 10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Recipient and MIPS and supersedes in their entirety any and all oral or written agreements previously existing between Recipient and MIPS with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended or supplemented by a writing that refers explicitly to this Agreement and that is signed or otherwise accepted by duly authorized representatives of Recipient and MIPS.\n[Build Project/build]   | \n[Build Project/build]   | 10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.\n[Build Project/build]   | \n[Build Project/build]   | 10.6 Export Regulations / Export Control. Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws. An export is \"deemed\" to take place when information is released to a foreign national wherever located.\n[Build Project/build]   | \n[Build Project/build]   | 10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials. Recipient hereby understands, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Pre-Release Materials may not be fully tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) Pre-Release materials are not suitable for commercial release in their current state; (iii) regulatory approvals for Pre-Release Materials (such as UL or FCC) have not been obtained, and Pre-Release Materials may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments or may not be suitable for certain applications and (iv) MIPS can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a production version of the Pre-Release Materials . MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.\n[Build Project/build]   | \n[Build Project/build]   | ANY PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS ARE NON-QUALIFIED AND, AS SUCH, ARE PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d AND \u201cAS AVAILABLE\u201d, POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.\n[Build Project/build]   | \n[Build Project/build]   | 10.8 Open Source Software. In the event Open Source software is included with Evaluation Software, such Open Source software is licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source software license agreement identified in the Open Source software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header as indicated in the Evaluation Software. Additional detail may be available (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation. With respect to the Open Source software, nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable Open Source software license agreement.\n[Build Project/build]   | ---------------------------------------\n[Build Project/build]   | Accept?
